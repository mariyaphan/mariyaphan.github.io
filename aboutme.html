   <p>My name is Mariya and I'm 13 years old. I was born on Thrusday 2nd Febraury 2006 in Phnom Penh, Cambodia. As you may already know by my age,
       I'm the youngest out of 3 sisters. My oldest sister is 27 years old and her name is Marika. My second youngest sister is 21 years old and her name is Maripich. 
       My sisters and I don't really get to spend a lot of time together, but whever we meet, we make sure that we'll build good memories

    <p>A lot of my friends know me as song writer/performer because I really love writing songs and then share them to my friends. Music is a really important
        part of my life because it used to help me go through the most difficult time and that is also when I defined my talent/passion. I wrote a lot of songs, but
        all of my songs are all of my stories with a little bit of imagination. I love to share my stories to others so I write songs.
